# Ostremote
this app for  remote devices 

use the code and enjoy.

If we work professionally or learn coding, many times we come across the public repositories. We use the libraries made available by other developers as an open source code or we make our contribution to a project, reporting/fixing bugs, and adding new functionalities. Certainly, we use these projects because they just come in handy, and offer a high quality solution. But would we use them if they lacked a user-friendly description
This project is for remote control of devices for 32-bit and 64-bit windows, and the project is used to prevent intrusion and test the penetration coefficient and security so that it will no longer be infiltrated by strangers. Good luck, thanks for your attention.
